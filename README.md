# GeneticAlgorithm
In this repository, I share the problems solved by the genetic algorithm.

GeneticAlgorithm   : In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, 
crossover and selection. Some examples of GA applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, solving sudoku puzzles, hyperparameter optimization, causal inference, etc.


tsp problem   : The travelling salesman problem (TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities,
what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization,
important in theoretical computer science and operations research.


n_queens   : The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.



knapsack problem 0_1   : The knapsack problem is the following problem in combinatorial optimization:

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine which items to include in the collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. 
The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or 
tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint respectively.
